# Assignment 2 — Username Two-Way Binding (Angular)

Problem statement:

"1. Add a Input field which updates a property ('username') via Two-Way-Binding
2. Output the username property via String Interpolation (in a paragraph below the input)
3. Add a button which may only be clicked if the username is NOT an empty string
4. Upon clicking the button, the username should be reset to an empty string"

How to run

1. Install dependencies:

   npm install

2. Build the project:

   npm run build

3. Run dev server:

   npm start

Notes

- This is a minimal Angular 15 scaffold. If you don't have Node.js installed, install Node 18+.
- The app demonstrates two-way binding via `[(ngModel)]` and disabling the reset button when the username is empty.
